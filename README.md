Description of work
Look for a Python Raspberry Pi Script that Does the following:

-User scans a barcode with a barcode scanner (think barcode on the back of a book)

Then

User Scans another barcode

IF,
Barcode DOES match, then it prints out a duplicate of that barcode on a label printer that is connected to the Raspberry Pi that will run this script.

IF,

Barcode DOES NOT MATCH, a label with the word "ERROR" gets printed, a 3 second alarm goes off.( alarm will automatically shut off after 3 seconds)
